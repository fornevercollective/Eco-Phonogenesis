Eco-Phonogenesis - create one long word that iterates on all the linguistics and sound phenomenon that travels from earliest carbon dating of animals vocalization through the hierarchal tree of humanity to now encompassesing all phoneme approximations - similar to Zettels Traum" (Bottom's Dream) by Arno Schmidt - known for its length and complexity, often being described as a book composed of one extraordinarily long sentence.

Visual Map of Mouth Shapes and Phoneme Embeddings

Overview

This artifact maps human phonemes to mouth shapes, includes cat purring as a specific animal vocalization, and provides a conceptual framework for universal phoneme embeddings. Animal phonemes, including those of cats, are approximated based on vocal tract similarities. The map is designed to be visualized as a table or diagram, with mouth shapes described for each phoneme category.

Mouth Shapes and Corresponding Phonemes

Phonemes are categorized by articulatory features (place and manner of articulation). Below is a table mapping mouth shapes to human phonemes, with cat purring and other animal approximations included.







Phoneme Category



Example Phonemes



Mouth Shape Description



Animal Approximation





Bilabial (lips together)



/p/, /b/, /m/



Lips fully closed, then released (/p/, /b/) or held with nasal airflow (/m/).



Similar in mammals (e.g., primate grunts, dog barks).





Labiodental (lip-teeth)



/f/, /v/



Lower lip touches upper teeth, air escapes between.



Rare in animals, approximated in some primate vocalizations.





Dental/Alveolar (tongue-teeth/ridge)



/t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, /n/



Tongue tip at teeth (/θ/, /ð/) or alveolar ridge; lips neutral or slightly parted.



Common in mammal vocalizations (e.g., cat hisses for /s/-like sounds).





Palatal (tongue-palate)



/j/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/



Tongue near hard palate; lips rounded or neutral.



Approximated in bird calls (e.g., parrot mimicry).





Velar (tongue-velum)



/k/, /g/, /ŋ/



Back of tongue at soft palate; lips neutral.



Common in mammal growls (e.g., big cats).





Glottal (throat)



/h/, /ʔ/



Open mouth, airflow from throat; minimal lip movement.



Universal in animal vocalizations (e.g., hoots, roars).





Vowels (open tract)



/i/, /a/, /u/



/i/: Lips spread, tongue high. /a/: Mouth open, tongue low. /u/: Lips rounded, tongue back.



Approximated in primate calls (e.g., gibbon songs) or whale vocalizations.





Cat Purring



Purr



Mouth closed or slightly parted, relaxed lips; vibration from larynx and diaphragm during inhalation and exhalation.



Unique to felids (e.g., domestic cats, cheetahs); no direct human phoneme equivalent. Contexts: contentment, stress, or healing.

Visualization Notes





Table Format: Use the above table for a textual map. Columns: Phoneme Category, Example Phonemes, Mouth Shape, Animal Approximation.



Diagram Option: Create a sagittal view of the vocal tract (side profile) with annotations for each phoneme’s articulation point (lips, tongue, etc.). Overlay mouth shape icons (e.g., closed lips for /m/, rounded lips for /u/, relaxed lips for purring).



Animal Phonemes: Since animals lack standardized phonemes, use spectrogram similarities (e.g., dog barks resemble bilabial stops, bird trills resemble alveolar trills, cat purrs show continuous low-frequency vibration).

Universal Phoneme Embeddings

Phoneme embeddings are high-dimensional vectors capturing acoustic and articulatory features. Below is a conceptual framework for universal embeddings, including cat purring, assuming a model like wav2vec or IPA-based encoding. Actual embeddings would be numerical (e.g., 512-dimensional vectors) but are described qualitatively here.







Phoneme



Embedding Features



Description





/p/



[+bilabial, -voiced, +stop]



High lip closure energy, short burst, no vocal fold vibration.





/b/



[+bilabial, +voiced, +stop]



Same as /p/ but with vocal fold vibration.





/m/



[+bilabial, +voiced, +nasal]



Lip closure with nasal resonance.





/f/



[+labiodental, -voiced, +fricative]



Lip-teeth friction, continuous airflow.





/s/



[+alveolar, -voiced, +fricative]



Tongue at ridge, hissing airflow.





/i/



[+high, +front, +vowel]



High tongue, spread lips, bright formants.





/a/



[+low, +open, +vowel]



Open jaw, low tongue, wide resonance.





/u/



[+high, +back, +rounded, +vowel]



Rounded lips, back tongue, low formants.





Purr



[+laryngeal, +voiced, +continuous, +low-frequency]



Continuous vibration (20-150 Hz), produced during inhalation/exhalation, relaxed vocal tract, no specific articulatory place. Contexts: contentment, stress, or self-healing.

Embedding Notes





Features: Include place, manner, voicing, and formant frequencies (F1, F2 for vowels). Purring is characterized by low-frequency, continuous oscillation.



Universality: Use IPA as a basis for cross-linguistic consistency. Animal vocalizations, like cat purring, can be mapped to similar features (e.g., dog bark: [+bilabial, +stop], purr: [+laryngeal, +continuous]).



Implementation: In practice, embeddings are learned via neural networks (e.g., wav2vec 2.0) trained on multilingual speech data. Here, we simulate with descriptive features.

Animal Phoneme Approximations

Animals don’t use phonemes like humans, but their vocalizations can be mapped to human-like articulatory categories:





Cats (Felids):





Purring: Continuous, low-frequency (20-150 Hz) vibration from larynx/diaphragm, produced during both inhalation and exhalation. Contexts: contentment (e.g., when petted), stress (e.g., at vet), or self-healing (vibration may promote tissue repair). No direct human phoneme equivalent; closest to a voiced, continuous glottal sound.



Hisses: /s/-like alveolar fricatives, produced with tongue near palate and air forced through.



Meows: Vowel-like (/a/, /e/), varying by pitch and context (e.g., greeting, hunger).



Growls/Roars: Velar/glottal sounds, similar to /g/ or /h/, in larger felids.



Primates: Grunts (/p/, /b/), screams (/a/, /i/).



Canids: Barks (bilabial stops), howls (vowel-like /u/, /a/).



Birds: Trills (alveolar-like), whistles (vowel-like).



Cetaceans: Clicks (stop-like), songs (vowel-like formants).

Usage





Visualization: Render the table as an HTML page or use a tool like Matplotlib for a diagram (code available upon request).



Embeddings: Use the feature descriptions as input for a speech synthesis or recognition model.



Extensions: Add spectrogram images for each phoneme or animal sound (e.g., cat purr spectrogram showing low-frequency bands) for a richer map.
