Visual Map of Mouth Shapes and Phoneme Embeddings

Overview

This artifact maps human phonemes to mouth shapes, includes cat purring as a specific animal vocalization, and provides a conceptual framework for universal phoneme embeddings. Animal phonemes, including those of cats, are approximated based on vocal tract similarities. The map is designed to be visualized as a table or diagram, with mouth shapes described for each phoneme category.

Mouth Shapes and Corresponding Phonemes

Phonemes are categorized by articulatory features (place and manner of articulation). Below is a table mapping mouth shapes to human phonemes, with cat purring and other animal approximations included.







Phoneme Category



Example Phonemes



Mouth Shape Description



Animal Approximation





Bilabial (lips together)



/p/, /b/, /m/



Lips fully closed, then released (/p/, /b/) or held with nasal airflow (/m/).



Similar in mammals (e.g., primate grunts, dog barks).





Labiodental (lip-teeth)



/f/, /v/



Lower lip touches upper teeth, air escapes between.



Rare in animals, approximated in some primate vocalizations.





Dental/Alveolar (tongue-teeth/ridge)



/t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, /n/



Tongue tip at teeth (/θ/, /ð/) or alveolar ridge; lips neutral or slightly parted.



Common in mammal vocalizations (e.g., cat hisses for /s/-like sounds).





Palatal (tongue-palate)



/j/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/



Tongue near hard palate; lips rounded or neutral.



Approximated in bird calls (e.g., parrot mimicry).





Velar (tongue-velum)



/k/, /g/, /ŋ/



Back of tongue at soft palate; lips neutral.



Common in mammal growls (e.g., big cats).





Glottal (throat)



/h/, /ʔ/



Open mouth, airflow from throat; minimal lip movement.



Universal in animal vocalizations (e.g., hoots, roars).





Vowels (open tract)



/i/, /a/, /u/



/i/: Lips spread, tongue high. /a/: Mouth open, tongue low. /u/: Lips rounded, tongue back.



Approximated in primate calls (e.g., gibbon songs) or whale vocalizations.





Cat Purring



Purr



Mouth closed or slightly parted, relaxed lips; vibration from larynx and diaphragm during inhalation and exhalation.



Unique to felids (e.g., domestic cats, cheetahs); no direct human phoneme equivalent. Contexts: contentment, stress, or healing.

Visualization Notes





Table Format: Use the above table for a textual map. Columns: Phoneme Category, Example Phonemes, Mouth Shape, Animal Approximation.



Diagram Option: Create a sagittal view of the vocal tract (side profile) with annotations for each phoneme’s articulation point (lips, tongue, etc.). Overlay mouth shape icons (e.g., closed lips for /m/, rounded lips for /u/, relaxed lips for purring).



Animal Phonemes: Since animals lack standardized phonemes, use spectrogram similarities (e.g., dog barks resemble bilabial stops, bird trills resemble alveolar trills, cat purrs show continuous low-frequency vibration).

Universal Phoneme Embeddings

Phoneme embeddings are high-dimensional vectors capturing acoustic and articulatory features. Below is a conceptual framework for universal embeddings, including cat purring, assuming a model like wav2vec or IPA-based encoding. Actual embeddings would be numerical (e.g., 512-dimensional vectors) but are described qualitatively here.







Phoneme



Embedding Features



Description





/p/



[+bilabial, -voiced, +stop]



High lip closure energy, short burst, no vocal fold vibration.





/b/



[+bilabial, +voiced, +stop]



Same as /p/ but with vocal fold vibration.





/m/



[+bilabial, +voiced, +nasal]



Lip closure with nasal resonance.





/f/



[+labiodental, -voiced, +fricative]



Lip-teeth friction, continuous airflow.





/s/



[+alveolar, -voiced, +fricative]



Tongue at ridge, hissing airflow.





/i/



[+high, +front, +vowel]



High tongue, spread lips, bright formants.





/a/



[+low, +open, +vowel]



Open jaw, low tongue, wide resonance.





/u/



[+high, +back, +rounded, +vowel]



Rounded lips, back tongue, low formants.





Purr



[+laryngeal, +voiced, +continuous, +low-frequency]



Continuous vibration (20-150 Hz), produced during inhalation/exhalation, relaxed vocal tract, no specific articulatory place. Contexts: contentment, stress, or self-healing.

Embedding Notes





Features: Include place, manner, voicing, and formant frequencies (F1, F2 for vowels). Purring is characterized by low-frequency, continuous oscillation.



Universality: Use IPA as a basis for cross-linguistic consistency. Animal vocalizations, like cat purring, can be mapped to similar features (e.g., dog bark: [+bilabial, +stop], purr: [+laryngeal, +continuous]).



Implementation: In practice, embeddings are learned via neural networks (e.g., wav2vec 2.0) trained on multilingual speech data. Here, we simulate with descriptive features.

Animal Phoneme Approximations

Animals don’t use phonemes like humans, but their vocalizations can be mapped to human-like articulatory categories:





Cats (Felids):





Purring: Continuous, low-frequency (20-150 Hz) vibration from larynx/diaphragm, produced during both inhalation and exhalation. Contexts: contentment (e.g., when petted), stress (e.g., at vet), or self-healing (vibration may promote tissue repair). No direct human phoneme equivalent; closest to a voiced, continuous glottal sound.



Hisses: /s/-like alveolar fricatives, produced with tongue near palate and air forced through.



Meows: Vowel-like (/a/, /e/), varying by pitch and context (e.g., greeting, hunger).



Growls/Roars: Velar/glottal sounds, similar to /g/ or /h/, in larger felids.



Primates: Grunts (/p/, /b/), screams (/a/, /i/).



Canids: Barks (bilabial stops), howls (vowel-like /u/, /a/).



Birds: Trills (alveolar-like), whistles (vowel-like).



Cetaceans: Clicks (stop-like), songs (vowel-like formants).

Usage





Visualization: Render the table as an HTML page or use a tool like Matplotlib for a diagram (code available upon request).



Embeddings: Use the feature descriptions as input for a speech synthesis or recognition model.



Extensions: Add spectrogram images for each phoneme or animal sound (e.g., cat purr spectrogram showing low-frequency bands) for a richer map.

Eco-Phonogenesis
A Sonic Speculative Fiction Project by Fornever Collective

Eco-Phonogenesis is an experimental, interdisciplinary project that explores the intersections of sound, ecology, and speculative fiction. By weaving together field recordings, sound synthesis, and collaborative storytelling, we aim to reimagine relationships between humans, non-humans, and their environments through sonic narratives. The project draws inspiration from ecological systems, Indigenous knowledge, and speculative futures to create immersive soundscapes that challenge anthropocentric perspectives.

Concept
Eco-Phonogenesis is a speculative exploration of sound as a medium for ecological storytelling. It asks:

How can sound reveal the agency of non-human entities in ecosystems?
What might speculative sonic futures sound like in a post-human world?
How can we co-create narratives with communities to foster ecological awareness?
The project is grounded in the concepts of biophony (sounds produced by living organisms), geophony (non-biological natural sounds like wind or water), and anthropophony (human-generated sounds). By blending these sonic layers with synthetic and AI-generated sounds, we craft immersive soundscapes that evoke possible futures, both utopian and dystopian.

Inspirations
Our work is inspired by:

Literature: Dune by Frank Herbert, for its ecological and speculative depth; The Overstory by Richard Powers, for its exploration of interspecies connection.
Sound Art: Works by Chris Watson, Jana Winderen, and Hildegard Westerkamp, who use field recordings to amplify environmental narratives.
Indigenous Knowledge: Practices of relationality and reciprocity with the land, particularly from Indigenous communities in North America and Australia.
Science Fiction: Post-human and eco-futurist narratives that reimagine humanity’s role in the biosphere.
Methodology
Eco-Phonogenesis is a multi-faceted project that combines several approaches:

Field Recordings:
Capturing biophonic, geophonic, and anthropophonic sounds from diverse ecosystems (forests, deserts, urban spaces, etc.).
Using high-quality field recorders (e.g., Zoom H5, Tascam DR-100).
Documenting metadata about each recording (location, time, ecological context).
Sound Synthesis:
Creating speculative soundscapes using modular synthesizers, granular synthesis, and digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Ableton Live, Max/MSP, and Pure Data.
Designing sounds that evoke imagined ecosystems or future environments.
Collaborative Storytelling:
Hosting workshops with communities, artists, and ecologists to co-create narratives inspired by the soundscapes.
Encouraging participants to imagine futures where humans and non-humans coexist in new ways.
AI Integration:
Using machine learning to analyze ecological sound data and generate novel sonic patterns.
Training models on field recordings to create “speculative biophonies” that imagine sounds of future or alien ecosystems.
Ensuring ethical AI use, with transparency about data sources and model training.
Multimedia Archiving:
Building an open-source archive of field recordings, soundscapes, and narratives.
Combining audio with visual and textual elements (e.g., speculative maps, short stories). ಸ
System: stories).

Creating interactive installations using tools like Unity to immerse audiences in sonic speculative worlds.
Goals
To foster ecological awareness through immersive sound experiences.
To amplify the “voices” of non-human entities in ecological storytelling.
To create a collaborative, open-source multimedia archive accessible to the public.
To inspire new ways of listening to and engaging with the environment.
Current Status
Eco-Phonogenesis is in its early stages. We have:

Additional Analysis and Context
Since you requested “all,” I’ll provide additional context and analysis based on the README and available tools, including an inspection of the GitHub repository and relevant web/X searches, to give a complete picture of the Eco-Phonogenesis project.

GitHub Repository Inspection
Repository Structure: The GitHub repository (https://github.com/fornevercollective/Eco-Phonogenesis) is publicly accessible and contains the README.md as the primary documentation. As of my access, there are no additional code files, sound samples, or datasets publicly available in the main branch, suggesting the project is still in early development (consistent with the “Current Status” section).
Issues and Contributions: The README references GitHub Issues for open tasks, but no specific issues are currently listed, indicating limited public activity or contributions at this stage.
License: The project uses CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, which allows sharing and adaptation for non-commercial purposes with attribution and share-alike requirements.
Web and X Search Results
I conducted a real-time search on the web and X for “Eco-Phonogenesis” and “Fornever Collective” to provide additional context:

Web Search:
No official website for the Fornever Collective or Eco-Phonogenesis was found beyond the GitHub repository.
No specific mentions of the project appear in major publications or sound art databases, suggesting it’s a niche or emerging initiative.
The tools mentioned (Max/MSP, Pure Data, Unity, etc.) are standard in sound art and interactive media, aligning with the project’s technical ambitions.
X Search:
No direct posts about “Eco-Phonogenesis” were found on X as of June 10, 2025.
Posts about related topics (soundscape ecology, biophony, speculative fiction) mention artists like Chris Watson and Jana Winderen, confirming their relevance as inspirations.
Some X users discuss AI-generated soundscapes in the context of art, but none specifically reference this project.
Expanded Analysis
Project Scope: Eco-Phonogenesis is ambitious, combining sound art, ecological science, AI, and community engagement. Its speculative fiction angle (inspired by Dune and The Overstory) suggests a narrative-driven approach, aiming to create immersive, thought-provoking experiences that blend real and imagined ecosystems.
Technological Feasibility:
Field Recordings: The use of Zoom H5 and Tascam DR-100 is standard for high-quality field recordings, suitable for capturing detailed biophonic and geophonic sounds.
AI Integration: The mention of custom Python-based ML models for sound analysis is plausible, as tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch can process audio spectrograms to generate novel sounds. However, ethical AI use (as emphasized) requires careful data sourcing and transparency, which the project acknowledges.
Interactive Installations: Unity and TouchDesigner are powerful tools for creating immersive audio-visual experiences, aligning with the goal of exhibitions and installations.
Challenges:
Scale: Capturing global ecosystems and building a comprehensive sound library is resource-intensive, requiring significant funding and collaboration.
Community Engagement: Workshops and collaborative storytelling depend on active participation, which may be limited by the project’s niche focus.
AI Ethics: Ensuring ethical AI use (e.g., avoiding biased datasets or environmental harm from computational costs) adds complexity to the project.
Potential Impact:
The project’s focus on ecological awareness and non-human agency aligns with growing interest in eco-art and post-humanism.
Its open-source approach (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) could democratize access to its sound library, fostering global participation.
Interactive installations could attract attention at art festivals or environmental conferences.
Potential Visualizations
You didn’t explicitly request a chart, but to enhance the “all” response, I can suggest a chart to visualize the project’s components (e.g., methodology breakdown). Since you haven’t confirmed a chart request, I’ll describe it instead of generating one:

Proposed Chart: A pie chart showing the distribution of effort across the five methodologies (Field Recordings, Sound Synthesis, Collaborative Storytelling, AI Integration, Multimedia Archiving). Each segment could represent an estimated percentage of focus based on the README’s emphasis (e.g., 30% Field Recordings, 25% Sound Synthesis, 20% Collaborative Storytelling, 15% AI Integration, 10% Multimedia Archiving).
If you want this chart generated, please confirm, and I’ll provide a Chart.js code block.
Related Questions You Might Have
What is the Fornever Collective? The README doesn’t provide detailed information, but it appears to be a group of artists, ecologists, and technologists focused on interdisciplinary projects. The email (contact@fornevercollective.org) and Discord server suggest a community-driven, collaborative structure.
How can I access the sound library? The sound library is not yet available, as the project is in early development. The README indicates it will be open-source under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 once released.
What are the next steps for the project? The “Current Status” section outlines plans for global field recordings, interactive installations, and workshops in 2024, though the README’s last update (October 2023) suggests these may still be in progress.
How to Proceed
If you meant something specific by “all” (e.g., all files in the repo, all related projects, or a deeper dive into a specific aspect), please clarify. Here are some options I can pursue:

Analyze the GitHub Repo Further: If more files are added, I can examine code, datasets, or sound samples.
DeepSearch Mode: I can perform a more extensive web/X search for related projects, artists, or technologies.
Generate a Chart: If you want a visual breakdown (e.g., methodology distribution or timeline), I can create a Chart.js chart.
Specific Focus: I can dive deeper into the AI models, sound synthesis techniques, or ecological implications.
Please let me know your preference, or I’ll assume this comprehensive breakdown of the README.md fulfills your request.
